;; An API to access the location of MODIS pixels at three levels: (1)
;; Within the tile, which is identified by a tile location and the
;; pixel location within the tile.  The tile identifier follows the
;; standard form: mod-h, mod-v, sample, line. (2) Global position, as
;; if MODIS tiles did not exist and the world was a single MODIS grid
;; at the supplied resolution. (3) An arbitrary, rectangular window,
;; which is defined by the pixel at the top-left corner of the window,
;; the width in pixels, and the height in pixels.

;; For levels (2) and (3), we are interested in both the [row column]
;; of the pixel as well as the unique index that is found by counting
;; from the top left and travelling left-to-right and then
;; top-to-bottom.  The unique index is not interesting at the tile
;; level, or at least we have never needed that index.

;; Everything is zero-indexed, so that the top-left corner of any
;; window will have row and column defined by [0 0] and index 0.

;; Note that if the global index of the pixel under consideration
;; falls outside of the specified window, then the conversion will
;; throw an error.

;; The API operates on three levels: tile, global, window. The
;; three-leaved hoptree is a deciduous tree that is native to North
;; America; it's bark is smooth but gets rough with age.
