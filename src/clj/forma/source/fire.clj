;; ### Schema Application
;;
;; The fires dataset is different from previous MODIS datasets in that
;; it requires us to keep track of multiple values for each MODIS
;; pixel. We must maintain a total fire count, as well as a count of
;; the subsets of the total that satisfy certain conditions, such as
;; `Temp > 330 Kelvin`, `Confidence > 50`, or both at once. We
;; abstract this complication away by wrapping up each of these into a
;; clojure map. For example:
;;
;;    {:temp-330 1
;;     :conf-50 1
;;     :both-preds 1
;;     :count 2}
;;
;; compound value, represented as a fire-value. We wrap
;; up collections of fire values into a timeseries-value.
