;; ## Dataset Information
;;
;; We chose to go with PRECL for our rain analysis, though any of the
;; global datasets listed in the [IRI/LDEO](http://goo.gl/RmTKe)
;; Climate Data Library's [atmospheric data page](http://goo.gl/V5tUI)
;; would be great.
;;
;; More information on the dataset can be found at the NOAA PRECL
;; [info site] (http://goo.gl/V3gqv). The data are fully documented in
;; "Global Land Precipitation: A 50-yr Monthly Analysis Based on Gauge
;; Observations", found [here].(http://goo.gl/PVOr6).
;;
;; ### Data Processing
;;
;; The NOAA PRECL data comes in files of binary arrays, with one file
;; for each year. Each file holds 24 datasets, alternating between
;; precip. rate in mm/day and total # of gauges, gridded in WGS84 at a
;; 0.5 degree step. No metadata exists to mark byte offsets. We
;; process these datasets using input streams, so we need to know in
;; advance how many bytes to read off per dataset.

(defn floats-for-step
  "Length of the row of floats (in # of bytes) representing the earth
  at the specified spatial step."
  [step]
  (apply * u/float-bytes (r/dimensions-for-step step)))

;; ### Data Extraction

;; Java reads primitive arrays using [big endian](http://goo.gl/os4SJ)
;; format, by default. The PRECL dataset was stored using [little
;; endian](http://goo.gl/KUpiy) floats, 4 bytes each. We define a
;; function that converts an array of little-endian bytes into an
;;  array of big-endian floats.

(defn resample-rain
  "A Cascalog query that takes a tap emitting rain tuples and a tap emitting

  For example, given a rain tuple [date row col value]:

    [2000-01-01 239 489 100]

  The corresponding rain tuple [h v sample line] in MODIS pixel coordinates is:

    [8 6 0 0]

  Definitely note that there's a join happening in this query! The value of ?row
  and ?col must be the same wherever it is used, and since rain-vals and
  wgs84-indexer are separate sources of ?row and ?col, Cascalog will use an
  implicit join to resolve the query. Powerful stuff!

  Arguments:
    m-res - The MODIS resolution as a string.
    ascii-map - A map containing values for step and nodata values.
    file-tap - Cascalog generator that emits rain tuples  [date row col value]. 
    pix-tap - Cascalog generator that emits MODIS pixel tuples [h v sample line].
    args - Optional memory file-tap of rain tuples used for testing.

  Query result variables:
    ?dataset - The dataset name (precl)
    ?m-res - The MODIS spatial resolution in meters.
    ?t-res - The MODIS temporal resolution in days.
    !date - The nullable date of the rain tuple.
    ?mod-h - The MODIS h tile coordinate.
    ?mod-v - The MODIS v tile coordinate.
    ?sample - The MODIS tile sample coordinate.
    ?line - The MODIS tile line coordinate.
