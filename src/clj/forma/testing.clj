;; ## Directory Management
;;
;; These functions provide assistance for directory navigation for
;; testing. One compromise we make here is the binding of
;; `dev-resources-subdir`; This is defined as `:dev-resources-path` in
;; `project.clj`, but reading either of these would force a dependency
;; on pallet or cake. We've included a test to make sure that `dev`
;; exists on any deployment of the given project; a failing test means
;; that this directory should be created.
