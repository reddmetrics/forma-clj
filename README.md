# What is FORMA?

The Forest Monitoring for Action ([FORMA](http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/forestmonitoringforactionforma)) project provides free and open forest clearing alert data derived from MODIS satellite imagery every 16 days beginning in 2006. FORMA is a project of [World Resources Institute](http://wri.org) and was developed by the [Center for Global Development](http://www.cgdev.org).

FORMA data can be seen in action through the Global Forest Watch initiative, a collaboration between the World Resources Institute, Center for Global Development, Vizzuality, Google, University of Maryland, and Imazon. It's a project that brings transparency to forest conservation through early-warning alerting and long-term monitoring systems.

# About the software

The FORMA software is written in the [Clojure](http://clojure.org) programming language and rides on [Cascading](http://www.cascading.org) and [Cascalog](https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog) for processing "Big Data" on top of [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) using [MapReduce](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html).
